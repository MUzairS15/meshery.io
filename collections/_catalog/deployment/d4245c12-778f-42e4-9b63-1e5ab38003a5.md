patternInfo: |
  Cassandra, a database, needs persistent storage to provide data durability (application state). StatefulSets make it easier to deploy stateful applications into your Kubernetes cluster.
patternCaveats: |
  It is recommended to run this tutorial on a cluster with at least two nodes that are not acting as control plane hosts.
